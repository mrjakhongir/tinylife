This project focuses on React Router 6 (so sorry for style and performance)
In this project I used **React UI** library. That gave me a lot of fun :) :
  - instead of using BrowserRouter, Routes I chosen createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, createRoutesFromElements;
  - this allows me use **loaders** for fetching data instead of useEffect;
  - I alternate absolute paths to relative ones for nested routes;
  - I have 2 types of pages protected and unprotected;
  - errorElement for display errors;
  - NavLink for styling active link;
  - async JS;
  - useOutletContext for passing data with Outlet component;
  - useLoacation hook for grabbing state which passed through Link state;
  - conditional rendering and filtering;
  - again I am sorry for styling...
